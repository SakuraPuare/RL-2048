# 2048 Game

A Python implementation of the popular 2048 game with both text-based and graphical interfaces.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 4Ã—4 grid.
- The game starts with two tiles (value 2 or 4) already on the grid.
- Use arrow keys to move all tiles in one direction.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum.
- After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell.
- The game is won when a tile with the value 2048 appears.
- The game ends when there are no valid moves left.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Pygame (optional, for GUI mode)
